In this course, I worked with OpenGL to recreate a picture in 3D. The project includes multiple objects, textures, lighting, and camera movement. Objects were created in Blender and imported into OpenGL.

These questions and the following summary relate to the final module journal:

    How do I approach designing software?
        What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
        What design process did you follow for your project work?
        How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

    How do I approach developing programs?
        What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
        How did iteration factor into your development?
        How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

    How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Generally I approach designing software iteratively, and base development on project requirements. I start with smaller items, test, and build my project up until all requirements are met, then test overall prior to make sure everything is working as it should. This was the approach I took in this class, slowly building up my project over the various milestone assignments. While working on this project, I gained some beginner skills in setting up an OpenGL scene, camera movement, and working with shaders. I also developed some basic skill working with Blender, as I used it to create the objects which were then imported into OpenGL. In order to get Blender obj files to work with OpenGL, I looked more into what issued needed to be addressed (specifically, indices were different for vertex coordinates, normals, and texture coordinates), then found a solution through http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/ which I included in my project (the objloader and vboindexer specifically). Moving forward, if I were to work with OpenGL again I would certainly incorporate Blender, as it is a much faster process to create complex objects, as opposed to trying to create vertex coordinates, normals, and texture coordinates in OpenGL. Moving forward I hope to use my basic understanding of 3D graphics as a starting point in creating more advanced renders, both for personal and for work purposes, should the situation call for it.
